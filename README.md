# TAP State Chart

The `tap-state-chart` repository is designed to model and simulate cap table transactions using the power of XState. This provides a robust environment to visualize, test, and understand the various transactional states and their transitions.

## Overview

This repository aims to provide:

- **Modeling Cap Table Transactions**: Using XState, we've created state machines that accurately represent the various states a transaction can be in and the possible transitions between them.
  
- **Simulation Environment**: This isn't just about modeling; it's about seeing these models in action. The simulation environment allows for a hands-on approach to understanding these transactions.
  
- **Potential Integration**: While currently standalone, there's potential for this to be integrated into the `tap-cap-table` repository. This would add another layer of validation to user inputs, ensuring accuracy and compliance.

## Getting Started

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

This will start the development server, and you can view the simulations in action.

## Future Plans

- **Internal Tool Development**: There's potential for this to evolve into an internal tool, possibly using Next.js, to provide a more interactive and user-friendly interface.
  
- **Integration with `tap-cap-table`**: One of the long-term goals is to integrate this directly into the `tap-cap-table` repository. This would provide an additional layer of validation for user inputs, ensuring that the cap table transactions are accurate and compliant.
